Run Modes

🔹 Quick Mode (default)

Settings:

parameters.quick_run = True
parameters.min_num_operators_key = 2
parameters.max_iteration_number_proof = 17

The system does not generate theorem candidates.
It receives a predefined list of theorems and attempts to prove all of them.
These inputs are sufficient to prove the six foundational theorems of Peano arithmetic:
Commutativity (addition, multiplication)
Associativity (addition, multiplication)
Left and right distributivity
Output: HTML proof graph in files/full_proof_graph/
Estimated runtime: ~1 minute



🔸 Almost-Full Mode

Settings:

parameters.quick_run = False
parameters.min_num_operators_key = 4
parameters.max_iteration_number_proof = 12

The system generates candidate theorems, then attempts to prove them.
Proves five of the six main Peano theorems (missing commutativity of multiplication):
Commutativity (addition)
Associativity (addition, multiplication)
Left and right distributivity

Output: HTML proof graph in files/full_proof_graph/
Estimated runtime: ~1.5 hours



🔸 Full Mode

Settings:

parameters.quick_run = False
parameters.min_num_operators_key = 2
parameters.max_iteration_number_proof = 15

The system generates all candidate theorems and attempts full closure.
Successfully proves all six of the Peano arithmetic laws:
Commutativity (addition, multiplication)
Associativity (addition, multiplication)
Left and right distributivity

Output: HTML proof graph in files/full_proof_graph/
Estimated runtime: ~1 day
