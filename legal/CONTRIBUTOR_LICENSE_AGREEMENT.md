GENERATIVE LOGIC CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)
This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is made between 

Generative Logic UG (haftungsbeschränkt), registered office in Sachsenheim, Germany ("Licensor"), and the individual or entity identified below ("You" or "Contributor").

1. Definitions

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that You submit to Licensor for inclusion in any project owned or managed by Licensor (each a "Project"), in any form (source code, object code, documentation, data, designs, tests, etc.).


"Submit" or "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Licensor or its representatives, including via Git hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub PRs), issue trackers, mailing lists, or direct email.

2. Copyright License Grant
You hereby grant to Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such Derivative Works.



3. Patent License Grant
3.1 

Patent Grant. You grant to Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 3.2) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Project to which it was Submitted.



3.2 

Patent Retaliation. If You (or any entity controlled by You) institute patent litigation or a patent infringement claim against Licensor or any recipient of the Project alleging that the Project or a Contribution (including combinations) infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Moral Rights
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You waive (and agree not to assert) any moral rights or similar rights (including rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal) in Your Contributions in favor of Licensor and recipients of the Project. Where a waiver is not possible, You consent to Licensor and recipients exercising such rights reasonably.


5. Your Representations
You represent and warrant that:


Originality or Rights: Each Contribution is an original work created by You, or You have sufficient rights to grant the licenses above.


No Confidential Info: Your Contribution does not include confidential or proprietary information of any third party.


Compliance: Your Contribution is not subject to any third-party license or restriction that would conflict with this Agreement (e.g., GPLv2-only code if the Project is AGPL-3.0-or-later, export restrictions, etc.).


Authority: If You are Submitting on behalf of an entity, You have the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement, and the term "You" will refer to that entity.

6. Outbound License and Dual Licensing
You acknowledge that Licensor may release the Project (including Your Contributions) under one or more licenses, including open-source (e.g., AGPL-3.0-or-later) and commercial licenses. Licensor has sole discretion to decide which license(s) to apply, provided that the outbound open-source license is at least as permissive as the one in effect for the Project at the time of Your Contribution.


7. No Warranty; No Support Obligation
Your Contributions are provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind. Licensor is not obligated to provide support for Your Contributions.


8. Notices and Identification
You agree to include in each Contribution a clear statement of any third-party code or materials included (with license terms), and to place the appropriate SPDX license identifier(s) in file headers where applicable.

9. Termination
This Agreement is effective as of the date You first Submit a Contribution and remains in effect for as long as Your Contributions are protected by intellectual property rights. Sections 2–7 survive any termination. Licensor may terminate this Agreement if You materially breach it and fail to cure within 30 days of notice. Termination does not affect the license rights already granted by You, which are irrevocable.





10. Miscellaneous

Governing Law & Venue. This Agreement is governed by German law (excluding its conflict-of-laws rules). The competent courts of Stuttgart, Germany, have exclusive jurisdiction.


Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between the Parties regarding Contributions, superseding all prior discussions. Any modification must be in writing and signed by both Parties (electronic signature is acceptable).



Severability. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid provision that most closely reflects the Parties’ original intent.


Language. This Agreement is drafted in English, and the English version controls in case of any conflict with a translation.
