GENERATIVE LOGIC COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between Generative Logic UG (haftungsbeschränkt), 
a company organized under the laws of Germany, registered office in Sachsenheim, Germany, commercial register no. 
HRB 800805 ("Licensor"), and [Licensee Legal Name], a [jurisdiction] company, reg. no. [●], with registered office at [address] ("Licensee"). 
Licensor and Licensee are each a "Party" and together the "Parties".

1. Definitions
"Software" means the Generative Logic Python project (including any C++ binaries or services expressly delivered under this Agreement), in source or object code form, together with related scripts, configuration files, and documentation provided by Licensor but excluding any open-source components separately licensed under their own terms.

"Open-Source Version" means the version of the Software distributed by Licensor under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 ("AGPL").

"Confidential Information" means all non-public information disclosed by one Party to the other, whether in oral, written, or electronic form, that is identified as confidential or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information.

"Order Form" means a document (including online checkout or quote) executed by the Parties that references this Agreement and sets commercial terms such as fees, scope, user limits, and support tier.

"Territory" means worldwide unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.

"Use" means to install, execute, reproduce, display, perform, or otherwise operate the Software solely for Licensee’s internal business purposes.

"Derivative Work" has the meaning provided under applicable copyright law but excludes mere configuration, parameter files, or scripts that do not modify the Software’s source code.

2. License Grant
2.1 Commercial License. Subject to Licensee’s full and ongoing compliance with this Agreement and the applicable Order Form, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 16.3), non-sublicensable license to Use the Software in the Territory during the Term.

2.2 AGPL Alternative. Licensee may, at its option, instead use the Open-Source Version under the AGPL. In that case, the terms of the AGPL govern that use and this Agreement does not apply to such use. Mixing the Open-Source Version and the Software provided under this Agreement in a single deployment may trigger AGPL obligations. Licensee is responsible for ensuring compliance.

2.3 Delivery. Licensor will deliver (or make available for download) the Software and license keys (if any) following execution of the Order Form and receipt of any initial fees.

2.4 Evaluation. If the Order Form specifies an evaluation period, the license during such period is revocable, free of charge, and limited to internal testing only. Sections 8 (Limited Warranty) and 9 (Disclaimer) apply during evaluation.

3. Restrictions
Licensee shall not (and shall not permit any third party to):

a. Use the Software for the benefit of any third party (e.g., as a service bureau or SaaS) unless expressly permitted in the Order Form;

b. Copy, modify, translate, or create Derivative Works of the Software except as allowed by mandatory law or expressly permitted herein;

c. Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except to the extent permitted by applicable law and then only after providing Licensor prior written notice and an opportunity to provide the information needed to achieve interoperability;

d. Remove or alter any proprietary notices, trademarks, or labels on the Software;

e. Circumvent or disable any technical protection measures; or

f. Use the Software in violation of any applicable law, including export control laws.

4. Fees and Payment
4.1 Fees. Licensee shall pay the fees set forth in the Order Form. All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable unless otherwise stated.

4.2 Invoicing & Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Licensor will invoice annually in advance; payment is due within thirty (30) days of invoice date. Fees are exclusive of taxes; Licensee is responsible for all applicable taxes, excluding Licensor’s income taxes. If Licensee is required to withhold taxes, it shall gross up payments so Licensor receives the full amount invoiced.

4.3 Late Payments. Overdue amounts may accrue interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law. Licensor may suspend the license or support for non-payment after reasonable notice.

5. Support & Maintenance
5.1 Included Support. Licensor will provide the support and maintenance services described in Schedule A (Support & Maintenance), if any, attached to or referenced in the Order Form.

5.2 Upgrades. During the Term, Licensor will make available to Licensee bug fixes and minor updates for the licensed major version. Eligibility for major version upgrades is governed by the terms of the applicable Order Form and the support plan selected by Licensee.

5.3 Exclusions. Support does not include development of new features, integration work, or on-site services unless mutually agreed in writing.

6. Intellectual Property Rights
6.1 Ownership. Licensor and its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and all related intellectual property rights. No title or ownership of the Software or any part thereof is transferred to Licensee.

6.2 Feedback. Licensee may provide feedback or suggestions regarding the Software ("Feedback"). Licensor may freely use, disclose, reproduce, license, or otherwise exploit the Feedback without obligation or restriction, provided Licensor does not identify Licensee as the source without permission.

7. Confidentiality
7.1 Obligations. Each Party agrees to protect the other Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same care it uses to protect its own similar information (but not less than reasonable care), and not to use or disclose it except as necessary to perform under this Agreement.

7.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information that is (i) publicly available without breach, (ii) rightfully received from a third party without duty of confidentiality, (iii) independently developed without use of the other Party’s Confidential Information, or (iv) approved for release by written authorization.

7.3 Compelled Disclosure. A Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives prompt notice and cooperates with efforts to limit disclosure.

8. Limited Warranty
8.1 Performance Warranty. Licensor warrants that, for ninety (12) months from delivery, the Software will substantially conform to the documentation provided by Licensor when used as authorized.

8.2 Remedy. Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the above warranty is for Licensor, at its option, to (a) repair or replace the non-conforming Software, or (b) terminate the license for the affected Software and refund the unused portion of prepaid fees.

8.3 Exclusions. The warranty does not apply if the Software (i) has been modified by anyone other than Licensor, (ii) is used in combination with other products not approved by Licensor, or (iii) is used contrary to the documentation.

9. Disclaimer
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 8, THE SOFTWARE AND ANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

10. Limitation of Liability
10.1 Indirect Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10.2 Cap. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR FOR THE SOFTWARE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

10.3 Exclusions from Cap. The limitations in Section 10.2 do not apply to (i) Licensor's indemnification obligations under Section 11, (ii) Licensee’s payment obligations, (iii) breaches by Licensee of Section 3 (Restrictions) or by either Party of Section 7 (Confidentiality), or (iv) either Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud or willful misconduct to the extent such liability cannot be limited by law.

11. Indemnification
11.1 By Licensor. Licensor will defend Licensee against any third-party claim that the Software, when used as authorized, infringes a patent, copyright, or trade secret, and will pay settlements or final damages awarded by a court. Licensor’s obligations are conditioned upon Licensee (a) providing prompt written notice, (b) giving Licensor sole control of the defense and settlement, and (c) providing reasonable assistance.

11.2 Remedies. If the Software is, or in Licensor’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Licensor may (i) procure the right for Licensee to continue using the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software so it is non-infringing and materially equivalent, or (iii) terminate the license for the affected Software and refund the unused portion of prepaid fees.

11.3 Exclusions. Licensor has no obligation for claims arising from (i) unauthorized modifications, (ii) combination with items not provided by Licensor, or (iii) use after Licensor has provided a non-infringing alternative.

11.4 By Licensee. Licensee will defend and indemnify Licensor against claims arising from Licensee’s breach of this Agreement or violation of law.

12. Audit Rights
Upon at least ten (10) business days’ notice, Licensor may audit Licensee’s Use of the Software no more than once per year, during normal business hours, and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s operations. If an audit reveals underpayment of more than 5%, Licensee shall pay the shortfall plus audit costs.

13. Term and Termination
13.1 Term. The Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for the period specified in the Order Form ("Initial Term"). Unless otherwise stated, it will automatically renew for successive one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term") unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then-current term.

13.2 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for material breach by the other Party that remains uncured thirty (30) days after written notice (ten (10) days for payment breaches).

13.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination or expiration, the license granted in Section 2 terminates and Licensee shall cease all Use of the Software and destroy all copies. Sections 1, 3, 4 (fees accrued), 6–11, 12, 13.3, and 14–17 survive termination.

14. Publicity
Neither Party shall use the other Party’s name or logo in any marketing or publicity materials without the other Party’s prior written consent.

15. Export Compliance & Sanctions
Licensee shall comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations, including those of the EU and United States. Licensee represents that it is not listed on any restricted party list.

16. Miscellaneous
16.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any Order Forms and Schedules) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements on the subject matter, excluding any NDA previously executed (which remains in force). In case of conflict, the Order Form prevails, then this Agreement, then the Schedules.

16.2 Amendments. Any amendment must be in writing and signed by both Parties (email is acceptable if clearly indicating intent to amend).

16.3 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement without Licensor’s prior written consent, except to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the assignee is not a direct competitor of Licensor and assumes all obligations. Licensor may assign freely.

16.4 Notices. Notices must be in writing and delivered by hand, courier, or email with confirmation to the addresses set forth in the Order Form (or updated by notice). Notices are deemed received when delivered or upon email confirmation.

16.5 Independent Contractors. The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship.

16.6 Severability. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force, and the invalid provision is replaced by a valid provision that best reflects the Parties’ intent.

16.7 Force Majeure. Neither Party is liable for delays or failures due to causes beyond its reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, war, labor disputes, government action, internet outages), provided it uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate.

16.8 Governing Law & Venue. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Germany, excluding its conflict-of-laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The exclusive venue for disputes is the competent courts of Stuttgart, Germany.

16.9 Language. This Agreement is drafted in English. If translated, the English version controls in case of conflict.

17. Data Protection (If Applicable)
If Licensor processes personal data on behalf of Licensee, the Parties shall execute a data processing agreement (DPA) compliant with Art. 28 GDPR. In absence of a signed DPA, Licensor processes only metadata necessary for licensing and support (e.g., contact, usage telemetry) as an independent controller.
